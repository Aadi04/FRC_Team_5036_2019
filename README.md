# FRC_Team_5036_2019
This is the source code for FIRST Robotics Competition Team 5036. I wrote this during the 2019 FRC build season as the 
lead programmer of the team that year. This was my first time writing such a big project and 
many changes were made in heat of moment at competitions, because of that the code is quite messy.
